# @opencode/ui (future package)

**Shared UI components.**

This folder will be extracted to `packages/ui` when patterns stabilize.

## Purpose

- Reusable React components (`<ChatUI>`, `<CodeViewer>`, `<DiffViewer>`, `<SessionList>`)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Built on ai-elements for chat UI
- Shared across web and desktop (Tauri)

## Extraction Trigger

Extract to `packages/ui` after **third use** of a pattern.

Wait for patterns to emerge organically - premature abstraction is worse than duplication.
